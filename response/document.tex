\emph{1. The signal model needs further work: $p$ is reported as “index” before
(1) and something to be demodulated in (3); in (1), which is the transmit
vector/symbol? }

\noindent \textbf{Authors' response:}
Thank you for the comment. As mentioned in the first paragraph in Section
II, the transmitted vector corresponding to two symbols are
$\bm{\phi}^(m)[p] = [\psi_1^{(m)}[p], \psi_2^{(m)}[p]]^T$, where
$p=0,\ldots,Q-1$ is the index/label corresponding to a bit sequence of length
$\log_2Q$, and in Eq.~(1) the transmitted symbols at the two RRHs are
$\psi_1^{(m)}[p]$ and $\psi_2^{(m)}[p]$, respectively. For instance, for 16-QAM where $Q=16$, in
one round of (re)transmission every 4 bits can be mapped to 2 constellation
symbols as in TABLE~\ref{table:mapping} and FIGURE~\ref{fig:mapping}.

To demodulate the information bits is equivalent to figuring out label $p$ from
the received signal $\mathbf{y}^{n}$ where $n=0,\ldots,m$ denote different
rounds of (re)transmissions. Since the noise is Gaussian distributed and we
assume perfect CSI at the receiver, the maximum-likelihood rule is in the form
of Eq.~(3).

To prevent possible confusion from our readers, we rephrase the description of
our signal model in the first paragraph of Section II, using similar
terminology as [4]. Most notebaly, we have renamed $p$ as ``label'' instead of
``index'' throughout the manuscript.

\emph{2. Some more not defined expressions/symbols/variables: in (2),
$\bar{\mathbf{H}}_a$ (first term); CSCG.}

\noindent \textbf{Authors' response:}
Thank you for pointing out this ambiguity. We have added descriptions on
$\bar{\mathbf{H}}_a$ and used the common notation $\mathcal{CN}(0,1)$
in place of standard Circularly Symmetric Complex Gaussin (GSCG) following
Eq.~(2).

\emph{3. Proposition 1: the proof is abridged in excess. For instance, the
derivation of (9) is hard to understand.}

\noindent \textbf{Authors' response:}
Thank you for the comment. Due to the page limit of the IEEE Communications
Letters, we cannot provide a thorough proof in the original manuscript and we
had to list only the key steps. A rigorous proof of Proposition 1 is as follows.
From Eq.(2) with the index of (re)transmission $(n)$ dropped, we have
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}[p,q] &= \sum_{a=1,2}\mathbf{H}_a\mathbf{p}_ae_a[p,q]
  \notag\\
  &= \sum_{a=1,2}  \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{K_a+1}}
  \bar{\mathbf{H}}_{a}\mathbf{p}_a e_a[p,q] + \sqrt{\frac{1}{K_a+1}}
  \mathbf{R}^{1/2} \mathbf{H}_{w,a} \mathbf{T}_a^{1/2} \mathbf{p}_a
  e_a[p,q]
\end{align}
where $e_a[p,q] = \psi_a[p]-\psi_a[q]$, $a=1,2$. Since the entris of
$\mathbf{H}_{w,a}$ are i.i.d distributed in $\mathcal{CN}(0,1)$,
$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}[p,q]$ also follows CSCG distribution. Its expectation is
simply
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}[p,q]] &= \sum_{a=1,2}  \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{K_a+1}}
  \bar{\mathbf{H}}_{a}\mathbf{p}_a e_a[p,q] \notag \\
  & =  \left[\sqrt{\frac{K_1}{K_1+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_1\mathbf{p}_1
  ,\, \sqrt{\frac{K_2}{K_2+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_2\mathbf{p}_2
  \right]\mathbf{e}[p,q]
\end{align}

\emph{4. In Section III.B, the method has not been presented with sufficient
detail. Why do you introduce x variables? What is the role of “flow” and
“distance” matrices? How do you derive (13)?}

\emph{5. The proposed solving method based on ILS has not been sufficiently

As per the other concerns, the assumption of two cooperative RRHs

The reviewer also questioned the consistency of our simulation result.

Once again, we thank the reviewer for the review and suggestions that helped to
significantly improve our revised manuscript.
