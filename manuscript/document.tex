% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In wireless data communication systems, high rate transmission under poor
channel conditions often leads to reception errors. To recover lost packets,
Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) or Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) are important mechanisms for
improving reliability at both network layer~\cite{TS36.331} and PHY
layer~\cite{TS36.213}. Constellation Rearrangement (CoRe) is a pragmatic
technique that provides additional robustness via Modulation Diversity (MoDiv)
to HARQ system~\cite{benelli1992new}.
As linear modulations of $Q$-ary constellations such as PSK, QAM are usually
adopted in practical wireless communications systems, the same string of
$\log_2Q$ bits can be mapped to different symbols across the multiple HARQ
(re)transmissions. This technique has been studied for point-to-point
HARQ~\cite{samra2005symbol}, relay
networks~\cite{seddik2008trans, khormuji2008rate} and
relay-HARQ~\cite{kim2009design, ryu2011ber, wu2016modulation} and is shown to
greatly improve the BER performance and throughput.

Also, in recent years, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission has become a
promising technique which has been supported by
LTE-Advanced~\cite{sawahashi2010coordinated}. By coordinating multiple base
stations or sectors, CoMP can effectively improve cell edge user data rate and
spectral efficiency~\cite{irmer2011coordinated}. When applied to CoMP, MoDiv
faces great opportunities and challenges at the same time which has not been fully
understood. On the one hand,
it is possible to adopt different constellation remapping schemes at different
transmitters, which could potentially provide larger diversity gain. On the
other hand, the optimization of more than one constellation mapping for each
round of retransmission is non-trivial, especially when perfect channel state
information (CSI) is not available.
In this work, we propose a MoDiv design scheme for a CoMP system composed of one
user equipment (UE) and two remote radio heads (RRHs) connected to the same
base station (BS). We assume independent Rician fading MIMO
channel between the RRHs and the UE, which is more general and practical than
existing works on MIMO-CoRe~\cite{bahadori2014performance, zhao2009harq}.
The CoRe is designed to minimize the expected bit error rate (BER) under
statistical CSI assumption after each (re)transmission. The resulting
optimization problem has a Successive Quadratic 3 Dimensional Assignment Problem
(Q3AP) formulation~\cite{hahn2008quadratic}. Although Q3AP is generally NP-hard and
cannot be solved exactly except for trivially small constellations, an
efficient modified Iterated Local Search (ILS) approach is adopted. Our
numerical results demonstrate significant gains achieved by the MoDiv techniques
in various simulation settings and performance measurements.


% Structure of the manuscript
%The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} introduces the
%TWRC-AF model and the HARQ protocol we are using. Section~\ref{sec:modiv}
%presents the successive BER minimization MoDiv design problem. In
%Section~\ref{sec:numerical}, we present the numerical results to show the
%performance gain of our MoDiv scheme. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
%concludes the paper.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:model}
% MoDiv as an enhancement of beamforming, 
Consider the constellation rearrangement (CoRe) in a MIMO-CoMP
downlink channel composed of two Remote Antenna Units (RRHs) and one user
equipment (UE). In order to maximize the signal space diversity as an
enhancement of beamforming, we allow different mappings of the same sequence of
information bits at the 2 RRHs during the HARQ process. We assume a HARQ
protocol based on Chase Combining (CC) and a maximum number of $M$
retransmissions.
For the $m$-th (re)transmission, every consecutive $\log_2Q$ bits are mapped to two
constellation points corresponding to the two RRHs via a vector mapping function
$\bm{\psi}^{(m)}[p] = [\psi_1^{(m)}[p], \psi_2^{(m)}[p]]^T, p = 0, \ldots, Q -
1$. Then the received signal at the $m$-th (re)transmission of index $p$ is:
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{y}^{(m)} & =  \mathbf{A}^{(m)}\bm{\psi}^{(m)}[p] +　\mathbf{n}^{(m)}
  \notag \\
  & =\mathbf{H}_1^{(m)}\mathbf{p}_1 \psi_1^{(m)}[p] +
  \mathbf{H}_2^{(m)}\mathbf{p}_2 \psi_2^{(m)}[p] + \mathbf{n}^{(m)},
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{H}_a^{(m)}$ is a $N_R$-by-$N_{T,a}$ MIMO channel between the
$a$-th RRH and the UE, $\mathbf{p}_a$ is a $N_{T,a}$-by-1 linear beamformer
for the $a$-th RRH, $a=1, 2$, and the additive noise
$\mathbf{n}^{(m)}\sim\mathcal{CN}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I})$. We
assume the elements of $\mathbf{H}_a^{(m)}$ follow correlated Rician
distributed channel~\cite{taricco2007optimum} independent across retransmissions
and between the two RRHs.
Specifically,
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{H}_a^{(m)} = \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{K_a+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_{a} +
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{K_a+1}}
    \mathbf{R}^{1/2}\mathbf{H}_{w,a}^{(m)}\mathbf{T}_a^{1/2},\; 
\end{align}
for $a=1,2$ where the $N_R$-by-$N_R$ matrix $\mathbf{R}$ and the $N_{T,
a}$-by-$N_{T,a}$ matrix $\mathbf{T}_a$ are the receive and transmit covariance matrices,
respectively, and $\mathbf{H}_{w,a}^{(m)}$ is a random matrix composed of
independent CSCG Gaussian entries with zero means and unit variances. Here we
denote $\mathbf{A}^{(m)} = [\mathbf{H}_1^{(m)}\mathbf{p}_1,
\mathbf{H}_2^{(m)}\mathbf{p}_2]$ as the equivalent MIMO channel from the two
RRHs to the UE during the $m$-th retransmission.

After the $m$-th retransmission, the receiver attempts to
demodulate $p$ by combining all the symbols received so far with the ML
detection:
\begin{align}
    p^* = \arg\min_p\sum_{n = 0}^{m}\left\|\mathbf{y}^{(n)} -
    \sum_{a=1,2}\mathbf{H}_a^{(n)}\mathbf{p}_a\psi_a^{(n)}[p]\right\|^2.
\end{align}

\section{Successive Constellation Mapping Design For Modulation Diversity}
\label{sec:modiv}
% Outline

\subsection{A BER Upperbound}
\label{ssec:ber}
The BER of the ML demodulator after the $m$-th (re)transmission can be
upperbounded and approximated by
\begin{align}
  P_{BER}^{(m)} = \sum_{p=0}^{Q - 1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q - 1}\frac{B[p,
  q]}{Q}P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) \label{eq:P_BER}
\end{align}
where $B[p, q]$ is the Hamming distance between the binary
representation of $p$ and $q$ divided by $\log_2Q$ as
in~\cite{samra2005symbol}. The computation of $P_{PEP}(q|p)$, the pairwise
error probability (PEP) of mistakenly decoding $p$ into $q$, generally follows
the procedure in~\cite{han2009performance}:
\begin{align}
    P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) & = \mathbb{E}
    \left[Q\left(\sqrt{\sum_{n=0}^m\frac{\|\mathbf{A}^{(n)}
    \mathbf{e}^{(n)}[p,q]\|^2} {2\sigma^2}}\right)\right]
    \label{eq:PEP_M}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{e}^{(n)}[p,q] = \bm{\psi}^{(n)}[p] - \bm{\psi}^{(n)}[q]$. Since the
$Q$-function can be bounded as $Q(x)\leq e^{-x^2/2}/2$~\cite{proakisdigital},
the PEP in~(\ref{eq:PEP_M}) can be upper bounded by
\begin{align}
    \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) &\leq
    \frac{1}{2} \prod_{n=0}^{m}
    \mathbb{E}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{A}^{(n)}
    \mathbf{e}^{(n)}[p,q]\|^2}{4\sigma^2}\right)\right]
    \label{eq:PEP_M_1}
\end{align}
Denote $E_n[p,q]$ as the expectation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:PEP_M_1}), which can be
evaluated as follows:
\begin{proposition}
  \begin{align}
    E_n[p,q] & =
    \frac{(4\sigma^2)^{N_R}\exp\left(-\bm{\mu}_n^H[p,q]\mathbf{S}_n^{-1}[p,q]\bm{\mu}_n[p,q]\right)}
    {\det(\mathbf{S}_n[p,q])} \\
    \bm{\mu}_n[p,q] & =
    \left[\sqrt{\frac{K_1}{K_1+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_1\mathbf{p}_1
    ,\, \sqrt{\frac{K_2}{K_2+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_2\mathbf{p}_2
    \right]\mathbf{e}^{(n)}[p,q],\notag
    \\
    \mathbf{S}_n[p,q] & =
    4\sigma^2\mathbf{I} +
    \sum_{a=1,2} \frac{|e_a^{(n)}[p,q]|^2 \mathbf{p}_a^H\mathbf{T}_a
    \mathbf{p}_a}{K_a+1} \mathbf{R}.
  \end{align}
  \label{prop:en}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We have $\mathbf{A}^{(n)}\mathbf{e}_n[p,q]
  \sim\mathcal{CN}(\bm{\mu}_n[p,q], \mathbf{C}_n[p,q])$
  where 
  \begin{align}
    \mathbf{C}_n[p,q] = \sum_{a=1,2}
    \frac{|e_a^{(n)}[p,q]|^2\mathbf{p}_a^H\mathbf{T}_a
    \mathbf{p}_a}{K_a+1}\mathbf{R}.
  \end{align}
  For $\mathbf{v}\sim\mathcal{CN}(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{C})$, using the technique of
  completing the square~\cite[Sec. 2.3.1]{bishop2006pattern}, it is easy to show
  \begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}\left[\exp(-\lambda\|\mathbf{v}\|^2)\right] =
    \frac{\exp\left(-\bm{\mu}^H(\lambda^{-1}\mathbf{I} +
    \mathbf{C})^{-1}\bm{\mu}\right)}{\det(\mathbf{I} +
    \lambda\mathbf{C})} \label{eq:elv2}
  \end{align}
  which in turn leads to Proposition~\ref{prop:en}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Successive Quadratic 3-D Assignment Problem (S-Q3AP)}
\label{ssec:q3ap}
Our MoDiv design aims to solve
\begin{align}
  \min_{\bm{\psi}^{(m)}|\bm{\psi}^{(n)},
  n=0,\ldots,m-1}\tilde{P}_{BER}^{(m)},m=1,\ldots,M,\label{eq:minber}
\end{align}
where $\tilde{P}_{BER}^{(m)}$ is the approximated version of
$P_{BER}^{(m)}$ by substituting $P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ with
$\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$. Denote $\mathbf{x}^{(m)} =
\{x_{pij}^{(m)}|p,i,j=0,\ldots,Q-1\}$ which represents $\bm{\psi}_m$, where
$x_{pij}^{(m)} = 1(\bm{\psi}_m[p] =
(\psi_0[i], \psi_0[j])^T)$ and $1(\cdot)$ is the indicator function, $\psi_0$
represents Gray mapping. Denote the constraint set
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{S} & = \left\{\mathbf{x}:\,\sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}x_{pij}=
  \sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}x_{pij} =\sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}x_{pij} =1\right\}.
  \label{eq:constraint}
\end{align}
Then Eq.~(\ref{eq:minber}) can be formulated into a S-Q3AP as follows:
\begin{align}
  \min_{\mathbf{x}^{(m)}\in \mathcal{S}}
  \sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}
  \sum_{q=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{k=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{l=0}^{Q-1}
  f_{pq}^{(m)}d_{ikjl}x_{pij}^{(m)}x_{qkl}^{(m)},
  \label{eq:SQ3AP}
\end{align}
where the ``flow'' matrix $f_{pq}^{(m)}$ and the ``distance'' matrix $d_{ikjl}$
are defined as
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    f_{pq}^{(m)} & = \frac{B[p,q]}{Q}\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m-1)}(q|p) \\
    d_{ikjl} & = \frac{(4\sigma^2)^{N_R}}{\det(\mathbf{S}_{ikjl})}
        \exp\left(-\bm{\mu}_{ikjl}^H\mathbf{S}_{ikjl}^{-1}\bm{\mu}_{ikjl}\right)
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where 
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{S}_{ikjl} & = 4\sigma^2\mathbf{I} + \left(\frac{|e_{ik}|^2
  \mathbf{p}_1^H\mathbf{T}_1 \mathbf{p}_1}{K_1+1} + \frac{|e_{jl}|^2
  \mathbf{p}_2^H\mathbf{T}_2 \mathbf{p}_2}{K_2+1}\right) \mathbf{R},\notag\\
  \bm{\mu}_{ikjl} & = \sqrt{\frac{K_1}{K_1+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_1\mathbf{p}_1
  e_{ik} + \sqrt{\frac{K_2}{K_2+1}}\bar{\mathbf{H}}_2\mathbf{p}_2e_{jl}.
\end{align}
and $e_{ik} = \psi_0[i] - \psi_0[k]$, $e_{jl} = \psi_0[j] - \psi_0[l]$.
$f_{pq}^{(m)}$ can be updated recursively while solving the S-Q3AP, since:
\begin{align}
  \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) & =
  \sum_{i,k,j,l=0}^{Q-1}\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m-1)}(q|p)d_{ikjl}
  \hat{x}_{pij}^{(m)}\hat{x}_{qkl}^{(m)}
  \label{eq:pep_update}
\end{align}
and $ \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(-1)}(q|p) = 1/2$. Due to the geometry
of the QAM constellation, the evaluation of $d_{ikjl}$ is actually $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$, and
it only needs to be evaluated once. Consequently, the main computational
complexity lies in solving the Q3AP problems instead of evaluating their
coefficients.

For typical constellations used in modern wireless communication systems such as
16-QAM and 64-QAM, it is impractical to apply the exact branch-and-bound
algorithm~\cite{hahn2008quadratic}. Also, our tests show that they do not have
enough symmetry to exploit for faster solution as does the 16-PSK
constellation~\cite{mittelmann2015solving}.
Consequently, the MoDiv problem is solved with the ILS
method~\cite{hahn2008quadratic} extended from its QAP
version~\cite{stutzle2006iterated}. Starting from two random initial mappings
$\psi_1^{(0)}, \psi_2^{(0)}$, the algorithm executes a local search by
exchanging the mappings of exactly 2 indices whenever a reduction in the
objective function is made. This approach can lower the objective function and
update the mapping locally. When the process hits a local minimum, it executes a
perturbation step by exchanging the mappings of $k_p$ indices, where integer
$k_p$ is adaptively adjusted within a range $[k_{p,min}, k_{p,max}]$. The
perturbation is accepted with a probability defined as in simulated annealing,
after which the local search is restarted from the new mappings until the
stopping criterion is satisfied.

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical}
Unless otherwise noted, we adopt the following
settings throughout our simulation. For the MIMO-CoMP channel, we have $N_R=1$
and $N_{T, 1} = N_{T, 2} = 2$. The correlation matrices at both RRHs are
$\mathbf{T}_1 = \mathbf{T}_2 =[1,0.7;0,7,1]$, while the line-of-sight (LOS)
components of the Rician channel are set to $\bar{\mathbf{H}}_{1} = [0.2540;
0.2457]$ and $\bar{\mathbf{H}}_{2} = [-0.1027; -0.2320]$, 
The Rician coefficients are $K_1 = K_2 = 4$ by default. A simple maximum SNR
beamformer (MSNRB)~\cite{barriac2006space} (generalized for MIMO channel) under
a total power constraint is used at the two RRHs. 
For the HARQ retransmission, the maximum number of retransmissions is set to
$M=4$. Three MoDiv schemes are compared, namely the simple retransmission with
no MoDiv, a heurisitic CoRe scheme proposed for
HSDPA~\cite{panasonic2001enhanced} generalized to our CoMP scenario by fixing
$\psi_1 = \psi_2$ and our Q3AP-based MoDiv design. The three schemes after the $m$-th retransmission are denoted
as NM$m$, CR$m$ and Q3AP$m$, respectively. 64-QAM is considered in our
simulations, for which each Q3AP is solved with 5 random initializations and
several minutes of ILS iterations.

First we compare the upperbound and Monte-Carlo average of the uncoded BER for
different $\sigma^2$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_noisepower_approx} and 
Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_noisepower_mc}.
Apparently, the BER upperbound in~\eqref{eq:P_BER} appears to be a descent
indicator of the actual BER when comparing different MoDiv schemes, and the Q3AP
solution offers a substantial performance gain over non-MoDiv and the heuristic CoRe. For
instance, at low SNR regime 1 retransmission of Q3AP MoDiv achieves almost the
same uncoded BER as does the simple retransmission without MoDiv, and 3 MoDiv
retransmissions are comparable to 4 retransmissions with heuristic CoRe.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_K_approx} and Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_K_mc}, the uncoded
BER is plotted against varying $K$ under fixed $\sigma^2 = 18$dB for $m=1,2$ and 
$\sigma^2 = 8$dB for $m=3,4$. A significant performance gain is observed for all
channel conditions ranging from heavily Rayleigh fading (small $K$) to very light fading (large $K$).

As another practical performance measurement, the coded BER performances of
the three MoDiv schemes are compared in a LDPC-coded system. A
LDPC code of length $L=2400$ and code rate $r=3/4$ is used. To demonstrate the
robustness of our Q3AP-based MoDiv scheme against design parameter mismatch, we
optimize the remapping only for $\sigma^2 = 5$dB and test the coded BER for a
wide range of $\sigma^2$. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:coded}, despite of the
mismatch in the design parameter $\sigma^2$, our Q3AP-based MoDiv is still able
to outmatches the other two MoDiv schemes, especially in the more likely
cases of a smaller number of retransmissions. 
Specifically, the waterfall curve of coded BER for 1 retransmission of Q3AP
almost overlaps with that of 2 retransmissons without MoDiv, and 2
retransmisssions of Q3AP outperforms the other 2 schemes by around 1.7dB and
4dB, respectively. The average HARQ throughput of the same LDPC coded system is
also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:coded_throughput}, which further verifies the
performance gain of the Q3AP-based MoDiv design approach.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the modulation diversity (MoDiv) design problem
for HARQ in a CoMP-MIMO system. Aiming to minimize the bit error rate (BER)
upper bound, we formulated the MoDiv design into a quadratic three-dimensional
assignment problem (Q3AP), and presented an efficient modified iterative local
search (ILS) solution. Our numerical tests demonstrate the performance advantage
and robustness of our MoDiv design over simply repeated use of Gray mapping
and an existing heuristic scheme.
